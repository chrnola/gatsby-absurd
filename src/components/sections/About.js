            <p>Imagine your next vacation, spontaneous weekend getaway, or business trip...but without all the stress.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>How much more relaxed would you feel if:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your pets were genuinely cared for in your absence <b>AND</b> they got to stay in the comfort of their own home.</li>
                    <li>You didn't have to do chores when you got home; your house, car, and backyard were already clean.</li>
                    <li>You didn't have to run out to the grocery store; your refrigerator was already stocked with your favorite foods.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All this and more can be scheduled at your convenience to help you find some peace of mind the next time you're away.</p>
