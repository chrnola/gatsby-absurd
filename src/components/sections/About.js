            <p>
                I would like to say thank you to everyone we have worked with.
                I am so grateful for the opportunities this community has given me the past 4 years, but it is time to say farewell.
                I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent in your homes getting to know your pets.
                For someone who loves dogs, I will always look back on this time fondly.
                This business was a great learning experience and I will carry the lessons I learned into my next venture.
                Thank you, thank you, thank you.
            </p>
