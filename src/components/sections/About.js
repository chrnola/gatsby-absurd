            <br/>

            <p>Imagine your next vacation, spontaneous weekend getaway, or business trip...but without all the stress.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>How much more relaxed would you feel if:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your pets were genuinely cared for in your absence <b>AND</b> they got to stay in the comfort of their own home.</li>
                    <li>You didn't have to do chores when you got home; your house, car, and backyard were already clean.</li>
                    <li>You didn't have to run out to the grocery store; your refrigerator was already stocked with your favorite foods.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All this and more can be scheduled at your convenience to help you find some peace of mind the next time you're away.</p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>Our mission is to create a welcoming, inclusive community.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                Recently, it appears that more Americans are â€œbowling alone".
                Political strife and socioeconomic differences have created deep fissures within our communities
                and have seriously challenged what it means to be a good neighbor. Despite having over 8 billion
                humans on this planet, loneliness seems to be on the rise. I believe that by creating a community
                that cares, we can improve the human condition locally, and create a runway for improving the
                human condition globally. It will be hard to change the world at large if we cannot simply trust
                those that live among us. Yes, we are just a pet sitting company, but is there a better place to
                learn of love and acceptance than from, say, a loyal dog?
            </p>

            <h3>Core Values</h3>
            <p>

                    <li>Treat all pets &amp; property as if they were our own.</li>
                    <li>Inspire others to learn and grow. </li>
                    <li>Go the extra mile. </li>
                    <li>Tell the truth. </li>
                    <li>Give back.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <br/>
