                Hi, my name is James and I have a love for animals.
                I had a dog named Maggie growing up and she was the center of my world as a child.
                We went for walks together every day and she always slept at the foot of my bed (but to be honest, if she had it her way I'd sleep on the foot of the bed and she'd sleep on the pillows).
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                I understand how pets become part of the family and they should be cared for in that same manner.
                Before starting this business I worked for a dog walking company.
                Despite that business being filled with great people, I realized that there was something missing and I wanted to venture out on my own.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                That missing piece was a sense of <i>community</i>.
                I love the idea of caring for your neighbors and creating a social safety net.
                That's why my business strives to be the "complete package" by offering other services in addition to pet sitting.
                I believe that caring for or cleaning something, whether it be a pet, a house, a car, etc. helps create a sense of ownership.
                My goal is for that sense of ownership to be reflected in my actions.
                I hope to provide the best service for you, your beloved pets, and your home while you're away.
                I understand it takes a tremendous amount of trust to leave someone in your home when you're away, so my promise is to help you find peace of mind with a pet sitter you can trust.
